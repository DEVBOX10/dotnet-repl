# dotnet-repl

![REPL preview in C# and F#](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/547415/121978422-02497600-cd3d-11eb-96c6-9725bda6dcaa.png)

This project is an experiment using [.NET Interactive / Polyglot Notebooks](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive) and [Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole) to create a polyglot .NET REPL for use on the command line. 

This is a personal project. Hopefully you enjoy it and find it useful. Contributions are welcome.

# Installation

To install `dotnet-repl`, run the following in your terminal:

```console
> dotnet tool install -g dotnet-repl
```

# Features

Here's what you can do with it:

## *Code in C#*

You can start `dotnet-repl` in one of a number of different language modes. The default is C#, so the following two commands are equivalent:

```console
> dotnet repl --default-kernel csharp
> dotnet repl
```

Once the REPL has started, you can type C# code at the prompt and run it by pressing `Enter`. (Note that this is the [C# scripting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2016/january/essential-net-csharp-scripting) dialect, which is also used in Visual Studio's C# Interactive Window and in .NET Interactive Notebooks.)

One notable feature of C# scripting is the ability to specify a return value for a code submission using a "trailing expression":

## *Code in F#*

You can also start up the REPL in F# mode with `--default-kernel` or set the environment variable `DOTNET_REPL_DEFAULT_KERNEL` to `fsharp`:

```console
> dotnet repl --default-kernel fsharp
```
```console
# DOTNET_REPL_DEFAULT_KERNEL=fsharp
> dotnet repl
```

## üìù *Submit multi-line entries*

By pressing `Shift-Enter`, you can add multiple lines before running your code using `Enter`. This can be useful for creating multi-line code constructs, including declaring classes.

Another handy aspect of multi-line entries is that you no longer need to use the the F# Interactive convention of terminating a line with `;;` to indicate that the accumulated submission should be run. Pressing `Enter` will submit the code, and if you need more than one line of code at a time, you can use `Shift-Enter` to add lines before submitting.

## üö• *Switch languages within the same session*

## üéÅ *Add NuGet packages*

You can use `#r nuget` to install a package for the duration of the current session.

## üå± *Initialize your REPL session using a notebook, script, or code file*

You can use a file containing code as an initialization script for the REPL.

```console
> dotnet repl --run /path/to/notebook.ipynb
```

The following file types are supported 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/547415/192895883-5e80e419-26dd-422c-b4bc-4d3533b861fb.gif" width="60%" />

## üèÉüèΩ *Run a notebook, script, or code file and then exit*

You might also want to just use a notebook or other file containing code as a non-interactive script. You can do this by adding the `--exit-after-run` flag. As long as the file extension indicates a language understood by .NET Interactive, it will try to run it.

```console
> dotnet repl --run /path/to/notebook.ipynb --exit-after-run
```

File formats currently supported are:

* `.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook, which can contain code cells in multiple different languages understood by .NET Interactive. 
* `.dib`: A .NET Interactive script file.
* `.cs`: A C# source code file. (Some language constructs, such as namespaces, are not supported, so this one is extra experimental.)
* `.csx`: A C# script file.
* `.fs`: An F# source code file.
* `.fsx`: An F# script file.
* `.ps1`: A PowerShell script.
* `.html`: An HTML file. (This will render in an external browser window.)
* `.js`: A JavaScript file. (This will render in an external browser window.)

If all of the notebook's cells execute successfully, a `0` exit code is returned. Otherwise, `2` is returned. This can be used as a 
way to test notebooks.

If you also want to capture the notebook output when it runs, you can do so by specifying the ` --output-path` and `--output-format` options. `--output-path` should be the file name you would like to write to. `--output-format` can be either `ipynb` or `trx`. `ipynb` is the default and will write a Jupyter notebook file with the outputs captured from the run. You can open this file using the [.NET Interactive Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) extension in Visual Studio Code, or any number of other Jupyter readers, and it can be displayed in GitHub. The `trx` format is a .NET test result file and can be useful in CI pipelines such as Azure DevOps, or can be opened with Visual Studio, or read with the [`t-rex`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/t-rex) tool.

## üõ≥Ô∏è *Import a notebook or script and run it*

If the REPL is already running, you can import a file into it and run it immediately using the `#!import` magic command. All of the same file types that `--run` supports are supported by `#!import`.

## üèÄ Pass parameters when running a notebook or script

If a notebook contains magic commands with `@input` tokens, running them in a notebook editor like [.NET Interactive Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) will create a prompt for user input. Values for these inputs can provided on the command line using the `--input` option.

For example, let's say you have a notebook called `notebook.ipynb` containing the following magic commnand:

```csharp
#!connect mssql --kernel-name mydatabase @input:connectionString
```

You can pass in the connection string from the command line like this:

```console
> dotnet repl --run notebook.ipynb --input connectionString="Persist Security Info=False; Integrated Security=true; Initial Catalog=MyDatabase; Server=localhost"
```

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è *Ask for help*

You can see help for the REPL by running the `#!help` magic command. I won't print it all here because it's a work in progress. Just give it a try.

## ‚å® *Keyboard shortcuts*

`dotnet-repl` supports a number of keyboard shortcuts. These will evolve over time but for now, here they are:

Keybinding      | What it does                                                      |
----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
`Enter`         | Submit and run the current code
`Shift+Enter`   | Inserts a newline without submitting the current code
`Tab`           | Show next completion
`Shift+Tab`     | Show previous completion
`Ctrl+C`        | Exit the REPL
`Ctrl+Up`       | Go back through your submission history (current session only)
`Ctrl+Down`     | Go forward through your submission history (current session only)


## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Magic commands*

Because `dotnet-repl` is built on .NET Interactive, it supports "magic commands". You can recognize a magic command by the `#!` at the start of a line.

You can see the list of supported magic commands by running the `#!help` magic command.
